These grains reflect sunlight more strongly than the majority of the visible colors, resulting in a beautiful blue sky with no color cast or shifted hues. The exact reason behind the different scattering patterns and color variations depends on several factors such as atmospheric conditions, cloud type, and temperature.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,11008,338,278,14744,7254,29973,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,1576,14744,7254,338,8581,491,278,14801,292,310,3578,297,1422,18112,2861,304,278,10122,310,21577,17105,313,29875,29889,29872,1696,21577,4799,17261,29879,470,1277,267,2000,19786,2646,1144,29897,29574,10106,278,25005,29889,4525,2646,1144,9432,6575,4366,901,13818,1135,278,13638,310,278,7962,11955,29892,9819,297,263,9560,7254,14744,411,694,2927,4320,470,9500,287,22888,267,29889,450,2684,2769,5742,278,1422,14801,292,15038,322,2927,21833,7111,373,3196,13879,1316,408,15489,8096,293,5855,29892,9570,1134,29892,322,10430,29889],"total_duration":5313547494,"load_duration":8500409,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":22081000,"eval_count":105,"eval_duration":5241323000}
